Peregrine Reserve - Drupal 7.x
------------------------------

The Peregrine Reserve site is served using the Drupal 7.x CMS. 

Project Files
-------------

Create a folder for the project files on your local Windows machine at:

	C:\development\projects\reserve

The project code for the Peregrine Reserve Drupal 7.x site is located in a git repository that you can clone to your local machine by executing the following command:

	# git clone ssh://10.3.28.25/mnt/repos/peregrine-d7.git 

This will clone the repository from the origin server variously referred to as "baba" or "babadev". The project files will be added to a folder named "peregrine-d7". Using the suggested local project folder path given above, you should now have a Drupal 7.x project located at:

	C:\development\projects\reserve\peregrine-d7\drupal

If you've used this path, the Vagrantfile shown here will work with minimal changes.
